# Mapping Chicago's Gun Violence: A History of Seggregation and Redlining created a Modern-Day crisis

Chicago is notorious for its high crime rate. The windy city stands out among its peers. Its firearm homicide rate is [six times higher than New York Cityâ€™s and three times higher than in Los Angeles](https://oneaimil.org/the-issue/impact-of-gun-violence/).

So far in 2023, 495 people have died from a gun-related homicide. **But, who is most at risk of becoming a victim of a gun-related violence?**

Though, highly diverse, Chicago is one of [the most seggregated cities in America](https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/march-2017/why-is-chicago-so-segregated/), if not the most.

Using data from the City of Chicago, the Census Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency, I find that gun violence is concentrated on the West and South sides, in a few specific neighborhoods. Nearly [75% of gun violence](https://www.chicagocred.org/our-approach/) takes place in 20 of the 77 Chicago neighborhoods

These same neighborhoods are predominantly Black. In addition to gun violence, they are hit the hardest by poverty. In a segregated city, gun violence disproportionately affect Black residents.
