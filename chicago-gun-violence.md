Chicago is notorious for its high crime rate. While some of it is exaggerated, the windy city stands out among its peers. Its firearm homicide rate is [six times higher than New York Cityâ€™s and three times higher than in Los Angeles](https://oneaimil.org/the-issue/impact-of-gun-violence/).

Experts states that Chicago is facing a gun violence epidemic. So far in 2023, 495 people have died from a gun-related homicide. But, who is most at-risk of becoming a victim of a gun-related homocide?

Using data the City of Chicago, I find that gun violence is concentrated on the West and South Side, in a few specific neighborhoods.
